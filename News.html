          <h3>'I like to play more attacking' - Pogba takes aim at Mourinho's negative tactics after Spurs win</h3>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="./resources/Images/pogba1.jpg" alt="image">
          <h4>The France international provided a sublime assist for Marcus Rashford to score the only goal of the game at Wembley</h4>
          <p>Paul Pogba has revealed he found it difficult to play under United's old tactics and hinted he is happier now the Reds are focussing on attacking football under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Pogba provided a superb pass to set up Marcus Rashford for the only goal of the game as United beat Tottenham 1-0 at Wembley on Sunday, helping the team win for their sixth game in a row since Solskjaer replaced Jose Mourinho in December.And the France international has been a player reborn under the Norwegian, playing seemingly free of the shackles that had hampered him during the difficult final days of Mourinho’s reign. The win at Wembley dragged United to within six points of the top four, a target that looked virtually out of reach just a few weeks ago when the team lost 3-1 at Liverpool.<br><br>“I love playing big matches and against the best players,” said Pogba after the game. “That’s where we improve and progress. It was a big one for us. Everyone played well.“I’m enjoying playing football. It was really difficult with the tactics we used to play. I like to play more attacking. Defending is not my best attribute.“The manager told me to get in the box, get goals. My best example is Frank Lampard, he’s the one who makes those runs.<br><br>“That’s what we want, that’s why we play, we need to keep it up, we won today and got three points.”“It’s a great ball,” said Pogba of his contribution to Rashford’s first-half strike.<br>“But we’ve been training on this. We knew that was the weakness of Tottenham. We needed to attack on the opposite side, that’s what we did and we scored a goal. We knew it would be very difficult, we knew we could hurt them on the counter.<br><br>“He [Rashford] makes a great run, he helped me for the pass, I tried to give him the perfect pass.”</p>

          <h3>Hazard as a striker helps Chelsea defensively - Sarri</h3>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="./resources/Images/eden.jpg" alt="image">
          <p>The manager felt the Blues performed better defensively with the Belgian deployed between two wingers against Newcastle United <br> Playing Eden Hazard as a striker provides Chelsea with greater balance defensively, according to Maurizio Sarri.<br><br>Belgium international Hazard has frequently played through the middle this season with Alvaro Morata and Olivier Giroud struggling for form.<br><br>The 28-year-old was deployed in the centre of the attack for the 2-1 victory over Newcastle United on Saturday and he set up Willian for the winning goal after Ciaran Clark cancelled out Pedro's opener.Asked if Hazard enjoyed operating as a striker, Sarri said: "Not in the first half. In the second half my feeling was that he enjoyed it.<br><br>"I wanted to see the solution with three small players. I think in this moment it is a very good solution because we are not less dangerous in the offensive phase and then in the defensive phase we are more balanced.<br><br>"In the last six matches, we conceded only three goals and one was from a penalty. I think that at the moment, in the defensive phase, we are doing very well. One of the reasons I think, in my opinion, is that Eden is playing in that position."</p>

          <h3>Solari's Isco snub nearly drags Madrid into total crisis</h3>
          <span>Rik Sharma</span>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="./resources/Images/isco.jpg" alt="image">
          <p>The Spanish star remained rooted to the bench on Sunday even with the club drifting even closer towards a crisis <br> First it was Cristo Gonzalez. Then Dani Ceballos, and, finally, Brahim Diaz.<br><br>Santiago Solari burned through his substitutes and, even with the scored tied at 1-1 against Real Betis and Real Madrid’s crisis deepening, left Isco rooted to the bench.<br><br> The coach’s refusal to play the Spanish playmaker, who a few months ago was a fan favourite and essential piece of the puzzle for both club and country, nearly cost him dearly in Andalusia on Sunday night.In the end luck favoured Madrid and despite Betis dominating in the second half, at one point having over 70 per cent possession, Dani Ceballos’s 88th minute free-kick earned Los Blancos a 2-1 win at the Benito Villamarin.<br>The victory takes them fourth, above Alaves, but still 10 points behind league leaders Barcelona. Madrid are in crisis and this narrow triumph does little to disguise that.<br><br>Solari’s evident dislike of Isco manifested itself again as the player was benched for the 11th time in 11 league games at the helm, despite the club’s injury crisis.<br><br>Even though Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos, Marco Asensio and Mariano Diaz were out, with Lucas Vazquez suspended too, the coach preferred to change to a 3-5-2 formation rather than incorporate him.<br><br>What at first looked like a move designed to humiliate Isco revealed itself as a tactical curveball for Betis, who struggled to handle a new-look Madrid in the opening period.<br><br>Madrid broke forward frequently and hit Betis on the counter. The hosts passed the ball about but as usual, didn’t have much forward thrust to go with their possession. Madrid were happy to defend as a unit when required, with every player back in their half, behind the ball at times.<br><br>Luka Modric broke the deadlock with a deflected strike into the top corner and the Croatian went close with another effort from similar distance.<br><br>Fede Valverde should have doubled Madrid’s lead which would have been a fair reflection on their performance, but fluffed his lines when sent through on goal, with a half-baked backheel failing to reach Karim Benzema.<br><br>The French striker was taken off with an injury at half-time and Solari snubbed Isco, preferring to hand B team forward Cristo Gonzalez his league debut.<br><br>As the tide turned in Betis’s favour, it looked like a matter of time before the hosts scored and Sergio Canales did so when played in by Giovani Lo Celso. Madrid hoped VAR would exculpate their defence but it only proved the midfielder was onside.<br><br>With the score level, it was surely time for Isco. But Ceballos was the next to come on, replacing Sergio Reguilon, with Nacho moving to left-back.<br><br>That was a snub for Marcelo too, one of the most creative defenders in world football, who was also left on the bench, helpless as Betis threatened to add to their lead.<br><br>Article continues below<br>When January signing Diaz replaced Valverde, it seemed like this was the hill Solari had chosen to die on.<br><br>Failing to win while leaving a player as good as unpicking defences as Isco on the bench would have generated such opprobrium among the media and supporters that Solari’s future would have been called into question.<br><br>But Ceballos saved the coach’s skin with his well-judged free-kick in the final stages. He lives to fight another day, but with no end in sight to the Isco saga, the situation may well repeat itself in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>The Spain international was unbeatable, making an incredible 11 saves to keep Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's winning record at United intact<br>David de Gea put in an inspired performance on Sunday to lead Manchester United to a clean sheet and vital victory over Tottenham - and he had the Red Devils faithful falling over themselves to pay tribute.<br><br>United took all three points in a tense top-six clash, with the only goal coming before half-time.<br>Marcus Rashford took full advantage of a terrific Paul Pogba pass and converted past Hugo Lloris to make it 1-0, a strike which proved the only goal of the game at Wembley.At the other end, however, De Gea had to be at his very best as Spain's No. 1 was bombarded throughout the game by Spurs.<br><br>No fewer than 11 shots on target were repelled by the goalkeeper, whose heroics helped United move level with Arsenal in fifth place and keep up their brilliant start to life under interim boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.<br><br>It was the most shots De Gea has stopped in a top-flight league match without conceding. <br><br>And he took all the plaudits from observers for his latest match-winning display in a United shirt.</p>

          <h3>Why Arsenal-bound Danis Suarez failed to make the grade at Barcelona</h3>
          <span>Daniel Edwards</span>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="./resources/Images/denis.jpg" alt="image">
          <p>The versatile midfielder is set for a reunion with former Sevilla boss Emery in north London after failing to win over Ernesto Valverde in Catalunya <br>After two-and-a-half immensely frustrating years at Barcelona, Denis Suarez looks set to make a fresh start in the Premier League.<br>The versatile midfielder will have the chance to relaunch his flagging career at Arsenal, with a January loan move now close. It is a fantastic opportunity for Suarez, who has failed to fulfil his potential since moving to Camp Nou.<br><br>But why did the 25-year-old fail to impress alongside the likes of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez? And can he show his best side for an Arsenal team that is also struggling to meet expectations after such a promising start to the season under new manager Unai Emery?Emery, of course, played a bigger part than most in Suarez's Barca move. After unsuccessful early stints at Manchester City and the Catalans ended, the then-Sevilla coach brought him to Andalusia in 2014.<br><br>In his only season at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, Suarez made 25 starts and 46 appearances in all competitions as the Rojiblancos won the Europa League and finished fifth in La Liga, with their loan signing from Barcelona contributing six goals and five assists to the cause.<br><br>That form earned Suarez a permanent move to Villarreal in 2015 and he performed even more impressively at El Madrigal, helping the Yellow Submarine qualify for the Champions League by scoring five goals and creating 11 others.<br><br>As a result, Barca decided to re-sign the former B team player the following summer by exercising their buy-back clause.<br>The youngster initially held his own in the Blaugrana's immensely competitive midfield. Indeed, Luis Enrique started Suarez 12 times in La Liga in 2016-17, while he also featured 14 times off the bench.With Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic Barca's undisputed midfield trio and the likes of Arda Turan, Andre Gomes and Sergi Roberto also battling for first-team places, becoming a regular was never going to be easy.<br><br>However, Luis Enrique had the utmost faith in Suarez's ability, even touting him as "Iniesta's long-term replacement".<br><br>"Why not? Players have to evolve. He has to improve. Iniesta is Harry Potter, he makes magic, and it is difficult to find another. But Denis is on the right path and I hope he can be Iniesta's heir.<br><br>"Denis is the youngest player in the squad and one of the few players to leave Barca B and be able to return. That is because of taking care of the ball but also working hard off the ball, which some players forget about.<br><br>"You have the ball for a minute or a minute-and-a-half in the game, so if you do not do well without it, you have no chance at this level. Denis understands that and he is well loved by his team-mates."<br><br>Suarez wasn't loved by Luis Enrique's successor, though. After racking up over 1,000 minutes of action in his debut season at Camp Nou, he saw his on-field time halved in 2017-18 under new coach Ernesto Valverde and things have only gone from bad to worse this term.<br><br>Suarez has managed a paltry 17 minutes of Liga action so far, with both Arturo Vidal and Arthur having leapfrogged him in the Barca pecking order.<br><br>Valverde has publicly insisted that Suarez "has a future" with the Blaugrana but also admitted that he will only be called upon when there is a need for rotation, admitting that he is just "one more player in the squad".<br><br>Consequently, a reunion with Emery at Arsenal – who are in the market for midfield reinforcements given the imminent exit of Aaron Ramsey and the uncertainty surrounding Mesut Ozil – seems the perfect move.<br><br>Suarez is seen as a strong option out wide, where he played so well under Emery at Sevilla, given with Barca he more often than not floundered occupying a more central attacking role.</p>

          <h3>'Tottenham striker Harry Kane is out until March with ankle injury'</h3>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="./resources/Images/kane2.jpg" alt="image">
          <p>Tottenham striker Harry Kane will be out until March after injuring ankle ligaments in Sunday's 1-0 Premier League defeat by Manchester United.<br><br>Spurs say the England captain, 25, will return to training in early March.<br><br>Kane, Tottenham's top scorer this season with 20 goals, is likely to miss both legs of the Champions League last-16 tie with Borussia Dortmund.<br><br>He will also be unavailable for the second leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final against Chelsea on 24 January.<br><br>Kane injured his left ankle when he was caught between United's Phil Jones and Victor Lindelof late in the game at Wembley.<br><br>Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said after the match: "It was a clear foul on Harry Kane, a big hit. [Referee] Mike Dean said he didn't see it."<br><br>Spurs, who are third in the Premier League - nine points behind leaders Liverpool - look set to be without Kane for the games against Chelsea and Arsenal on 27 February and 2 March respectively.<br><br>Tottenham forward Son Heung-min is currently on international duty with South Korea at the Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates.<br>Son, who has scored 12 goals, could be unavailable until February depending on how far South Korea progress. The final is on 1 February.<br><br>France midfielder Moussa Sissoko was replaced in the first half against United with what appeared to be a hamstring injury.<br><br>Tottenham's back-up strikers are Fernando Llorente, who has scored four goals in 13 appearances this season, and Vincent Janssen, who has not played for the first team since August 2017.<br><br>England face the Czech Republic on 22 March and Montenegro on 25 March in Euro 2020 qualifiers.<br><br><strong>'A devastating blow to Spurs'</strong><br/><br>By: Chief football writer Phil McNulty<br>Kane's lengthy absence is a devastating blow to Tottenham at a defining stage of the season as they fight on all fronts.

<br>Pochettino has no striker anywhere near the calibre of Kane and he will have looked at the fixture list with anguish as the worst fears about his ankle injury were confirmed.<br>

<br>Kane will miss the second leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final at Chelsea - and the final on 24 February should they go through - as well as the FA Cup fourth round trip to Crystal Palace.<br>

<br>And with him not scheduled to return to training until early March, he will struggle to make even the second leg of the last 16 Champions League game with Borussia Dortmund - as well as missing a host of league matches.<br>

<br>Fernando Llorente is able but not in Kane's class while Pochettino made it clear Vincent Janssen has no place in his plans.<br>

<br>Does Pochettino delve into the market? Does he even have the finance to do so? He may have to in this emergency.<br>

<br>Kane is the Spurs talisman and their world-class marksman. This development will provide a huge test of Pochettino's management and his team's character.<br></p>
